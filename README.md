- ‚ö° About me: 
<h4 align="left">**I love developing my skills and learning new things.
For this reason, I started to learn programming using the Python language.

While learning programming I liked it a lot, so much so that I thought about changing my career path. Encountering errors and problems while programming motivates me to solve them, and finishing a working script makes me extremely happy.

Worked with:
- Python 3.x
- Django 2.x
- HTML
- GIT

Other module:
Pygame, matplotlib, plotly, os.path, requests, BeautifulShop, selenium, OPENPYXL, PyPDF2, python-docx, JSON, csv, time, datatime, SMTP, pillow, pyautogui
   
Other: Linux, Bash, PyCharm.

My goal:
- Back-End (Python) Developer or Software Tester

I am currently learning: application testing using Robot Framework module. I am interested in Machine Learning and AI.

I am comfortable working with Linux operating system and terminal writing simple scripts (Bash). I am looking to start a career as a software developer or tester using the Python language.

Also:

I am a professional mechanical engineer.
I love the complexity and beauty of engineering. I like challenges and learning new things. I try my best to understand the problems I am solving. I'm always looking for a challenge. I love solving difficult problems and learning new things at the same time.

Currently, I want to connect my professional career with Finite Element Analysis (FEA) and Python. For this reason, I attend trainings, read literature and carry out practical projects in the comfort of my home.

Privately, a lover of cosmos space, sports (bike, hiking) and dog (currently I have a White Swiss Shepard named Riko).**</h4>
